Neoclassycle
============
A modern interpretation of the [Classycle].

About
-----
Neoclassycle analyses and enforces static cyclic dependencies in Java code.

Neoclassycle's Analyser analyses the static class and package dependencies. It is especially helpful for finding cyclic dependencies between classes or packages.

Neoclassycle's Dependency Checker searches for unwanted class dependencies described in a dependency definition file. Dependency checking helps to monitor whether certain architectural constrains (e.g. in a layered architecture) are fulfilled or not.
